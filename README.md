**Sidewinder** is an open-source [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) starter kit that focuses on good defaults, developer experience, and deployment. Also, [a snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_cerastes).

Sidewinder is opinionated to provide smooth experience from starting a new project to deploying it on a single Virtual Private Server (VPS). It is ideal for indie hackers, educators, students and the like.

With Sidewinder you will:

* Use a modern Python dependency manager Poetry to manage your application's virtual environment
* Use environment variables instead of juggling multiple configuration files
* Use HTMX for modern frontends
* Use django-allauth to provide email-based and 3rd party authentication.
* Have a custom User model for ultimate flexibility
* Have Django REST Framework at your disposal right from the start, including modern API docs, standardized error responses, and CORS configuration
* Have a Huey task queue for background and periodic tasks
* Have state-of-the-art development tools including auto reloading, debugging and profiling tools, linters and formatters
* Log anything you want with structured logging
* Execute automated tests using the best testing library pytest
* Write test fixtures efficiently using factoryboy and Faker
* End-to-end test your frontend using Playwright
* Deploy to your own VPS in the "It just works" style using Ansible
* Not be limited in customization as all important files are exposed and ready to be changed
